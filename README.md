# SWDV-630-2W-20-SU2---Week-1---In-your-Interface
Using Thonny, Visual Studio or command line interface expand on the Teams class defined as:

class Teams:
  def __init__(self, members):
    self.__myTeam = members

  def __len__(self):
    return len(self.__myTeam)

def main():
  classmates = Teams(['John', 'Steve', 'Tim'])
  print (len(classmates))

main()

 

1) Add the __contains__ protocol and show whether or not  'Tim' and 'Sam' are part of our team.  

2) Add the __iter__ protocol and show how you can print each member of the classmates object.

3) Determine if the class classmates implements the __len__ method.

 

4) Explain the difference between interfaces and implementation. 

5) Using both visual and written descriptions, think through the interface-implementation of a large scale storage system.   
In many systems today, we have the ability to store information from a single application to a variety of storage devices - local storage (hard drive, usb), the cloud and/or some new medium in the future.   
How would you design an interface structure such that all of the possible implementations could store data effectively.
